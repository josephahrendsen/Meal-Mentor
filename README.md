# Meal Mentor
### What is it
Meal Mentor is the helper you always wanted in the kitchen. It is an Android application that helps people by narrowing down their meal choices to only things that they have the time, ability, and ingredients to make. 
Our application will take in 3 parameters from the user:
<ol>
  <li>What ingredients they have</li>
 <li>The range of calories intake</li>
 <li>How long the meal takes to cook From here it will filter out the recipes the match what the user entered.</li>
</ol>
From these, it wil return recipes filtered by the parameters.

### Inspiration
We were inspired to build this application because we wanted a conveniant way to find meals we knew we could eat based on what we had.

### What we used
The app was developed using Android Studio. Meal Mentor integrated the Edamam API for recipe searches. We used a tool called Postman to help us analyze the JSON data.
